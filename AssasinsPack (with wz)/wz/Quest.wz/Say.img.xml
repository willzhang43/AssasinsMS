			<string name="4" value="After leaving the realm of Ellinia where I began my training, and having exhausted my avenues of learning at an early age, I traveled the distant reaches of space for many years in search of new things, new ways to improve on my abilities as a magician.  Other than a few not-so-amicable run-ins with the Grays, it turns out that space is...well, mostly made of space.\r\nJust when I had despaired of finding new frontiers to explore, I heard that Masteria had appeared off of Victoria Island, emerging from the depths of the sea!  The tales of this place had always intrigued me-this land is rumored to be where those come to find their destiny; or in other words, gain greater power.  I had heard legends of the Grandmasters of the fabled Crimsonwood Keep, how they were without peer in their chosen professions.  Exactly the sort of place I&apos;d been looking for to extend my knowledge!  Who knew that that such a place would be on the very planet that I&apos;d left?  And as luck would have it, one of the very things I had searched for in space has been found here!\r\n\r\n#b#L0#What are you looking for exactly?#l"/>
			<string name="5" value="In my pursuit of power, I have become a weapons crafter by trade.  I design all kinds... from handheld armaments to star-breakers on battle cruisers.  Years ago, I came across a very rare element called #bWhite Versal Materia#k. I had only a small sample of it but even in that small amount I saw the potential of the material!  It could be used to create weapons of tremendous power!  I studied it extensively, and drew up many schematics for weapon designs.  But alas, I did not have enough of the material to actually construct any of these weapons.  I had thought that it was a material found in outer space, and truth be told, one of the primary reasons why I journeyed into the far reaches of the galaxy was to find more.  But from what I&apos;ve learned, it&apos;s not even from this world!  Rather, it&apos;s from an alternate dimension of the Maple World...a world called Versal!\r\n\r\n#b#L0#Whoa!#l"/>
			<string name="6" value="Imagine my amazement upon my arrival in Masteria when I began to hear that adventurers here have been finding it!

Should you find any, please return it to me!  In exchange for allowing me to try out and perfect my designs, you can keep the weapon I create.  Deal?"/>

This house used to belong to a Master Toymaker named Jonas Prendergast.  Jonas used to make marvelous toys... dolls that danced, stuffed animals that walked and talked!  Every kid wanted a Prendergast toy for Christmas!\r\nTo keep up with demand, Jonas built a marvelous Toy Machine at the top of his house to automate his toy creation process.  Children from all over Maple World used to come here to see his creations and beg their parents to buy them-- and Jonas would hold lavish parties every holiday for them.  As a matter of fact, right around this time of year, every year, Jonas would have an elaborate Halloween party, giving away toys instead of candies for the trick-or-treating kids, but only for the ones who came with costumes of course!\r\n\r\n#L0##bA toymaker&apos;s house?

				<string name="1" value="&lt;Sigh&gt; It is as I feared.  I should say, Master Prendergast was once the premier toy maker, but as you can see, this place, and his reputation, has recently fallen into a bit of disrepair.  Master Prendergast once made the most wondrous toys, his delightful creations were beloved by all children!

If you can help me by bringing me #b60 #t4000018##k, it would get Ludmilla off my back, at least for the moment.  Ludmilla is Master Prendergast&apos;s current wife, the current lady of the house.  She has been complaining about the chill.  Do hurry with the wood, Ludmilla can be quite the merciless nag!"/>

					<string name="0" value="She was the daughter any father would be proud of. Smart, pretty, lovable... whenever she walked in the room, it was like a ray of sunshine.  She was spirited, adventuresome, mischievous.  The entire household loved her, it was a joy to see her playing about the house, always embarking on some adventure of her own design.  Her smile alone could brighten anyone&apos;s day!\r\nSophilia loved playing with everything - jewelry, dolls, rocking horses, she&apos;d get her hands on everything she could, that little girl!  Her father was often busy with his work, and her stepmother despised her, so she was often left alone to her own devices.  This house is far from town, and rather than real friends, Sophilia had to make do with her father&apos;s toys, and her own imagination.  We played with her when we could, but we were often busy with work, and tending to Master Prendergast&apos;s business and Ludmilla&apos;s needs.  A few weeks ago, we realized that none of us had seen Sophilia in awhile.\r\nThen one day, a few days thereafter, I... I found her.  No one knew what happened exactly, but it looked like she&apos;d somehow taken to exploring the inside of the house, and had taken a fall while climbing the Chimney.  Of all places for a young child to be!  What on earth could have possessed her to do such a thing?\r\nBut I... I blame myself.  I should&apos;ve watched her a bit closer.  In fact, now that I think of it, the last few times I saw that sweet girl alive, she kept asking me if I had seen her doll.  I was busy and thought nothing of it as her father had made her so many to play with.  &lt;Sob&gt;  I&apos;m sorry; it pains me to think that a life so dear and sweet could be so easily extinguished."/>
					<string name="1" value="No one took Sophilia&apos;s death harder than Master Prendergast.  He withdrew from Ludmilla, the household, from life.  For weeks he was beside himself with grief, refusing to eat.  He even shut down his Toy Machine and stopped all production on his toys.  A few days ago, he locked himself up in his Toy Workshop at the top of this house, and the noises of his Toy Machine began again.  He began making toys again. &lt;shudders&gt; But, these toys sound nothing like the toys he used to make before.  Can&apos;t you hear them?  I fear that his beloved daughter&apos;s death may have driven Master Prendergast past his senses.  I am afraid for him, but I am also afraid to go up to the Workshop now because of the noises.\r\nYou look brave.  If you could, please check on him for me, will you?  Master Prendergast&apos;s Workshop is located near the top of the house.  It&apos;s only accessible through one wing of the house, which is only reachable through the doors at the top of the Library.  I&apos;d be wary-it&apos;s a dangerous place, with open machinery.  Please... see how he is.  We are all quite worried about him."/>
					<string name="2" value="I am not alone in that, my young friend.  Ludmilla, is, shall we say, difficult.  I have been a professional manservant for decades, but she tries even my patience. &lt;trembles with rage&gt;\r\nThe woman orders me around all day, and does nothing but eat, shop, and lay about.  It&apos;s like being subject to the whim of a spoiled dog.  However, even that is within my duties... but there are other reasons for my feelings.\r\nWhen I said that Sophilia could brighten anyone&apos;s day, I meant anyone except for Ludmilla, that is.  I believe she was jealous of Master Prendergast&apos;s affection for her.  She usually ignored young mistress Sophilia but all of us could sense the resentment she bore her.\r\nBut enough, I shall remain the professional, and speak no more on this."/>

					<string name="0" value="She was the daughter any father would be proud of. Smart, pretty, lovable...whenever she walked in the room, it was like a ray of sunshine.  She was spirited, adventuresome, mischievous.  The entire household loved her, it was a joy to see her playing about the house, always embarking on some adventure of her own design.  Her smile alone could brighten anyone&apos;s day!\r\nSophilia loved playing with everything-jewelry, dolls, rocking horses, she&apos;d get her hands of everything she could, that little girl!  Her father was often busy with his work, and her stepmother despised her, so she was often left alone to her own devices.  This house is far from town, and rather than real friends, Sophilia had to make do with her father&apos;s toys, and her own imagination.  We played with her when we could, but we were often busy with work, and tending to Master Prendergast&apos;s business and Ludmilla&apos;s needs. A few weeks ago, we realized that none of us had seen Sophilia in awhile.\r\nThen one day, a few days thereafter, I... I found her.  No one knew what happened exactly, but it looked like she&apos;d somehow taken to exploring the inside of the house, and had taken a fall.  I... I blame myself.  I should&apos;ve watched her a bit closer.  &lt;Sob&gt;  I&apos;m sorry; it pains me to think that a life so dear and sweet could be so easily extinguished."/>
					<string name="1" value="No one took Sophilia&apos;s death harder than Master Prendergast.  He withdrew from Ludmilla, the household, from life.  For weeks he was beside himself with grief, refusing to eat.  He even shut down his Toy Machine and stopped all production on his toys.  A few days ago, he locked himself up in his Toy Workshop at the top of this house, and the noises of his Toy Machine began again.  He began making toys again. &lt;shudders&gt; But, these toys sound nothing like the toys he used to make before.  Can&apos;t you hear them?  I fear that his beloved daughter&apos;s death may have driven Master Prendergast past his senses.  I am afraid for him, but I am also afraid to go up to the Workshop now because of the noises.\r\nYou look brave.  If you could, please check on him for me, will you?  Master Prendergast&apos;s Workshop is located near the top of the house.  It&apos;s only accessible through one wing of the house, which is only reachable through the doors at the top of the Library.  I&apos;d be wary-it&apos;s a dangerous place, with open machinery.  Please... see how he is.  We are all quite worried about him."/>
					<string name="2" value="I am not alone in that, my young friend.  Ludmilla, is, shall we say, difficult.  I have been a professional manservant for decades, but she tries even my patience. &lt;trembles with rage&gt;\r\nThe woman orders me around all day, and does nothing but eat, shop, and lay about.  It&apos;s like being subject to the whim of a spoiled dog.  However, even that is within my duties... but there are other reasons for my feelings.\r\nWhen I said that Sophilia could brighten anyone&apos;s day, I meant anyone except for Ludmilla, that is.  I believe she was jealous of Master Prendergast&apos;s affection for her.  She usually ignored young mistress Sophilia but all of us could sense the resentment she bore her.\r\nBut enough, I shall remain the professional, and speak no more on this."/>

Why, just imagine the best birthday you&apos;ve ever had... and Versalmas is a hundred times better than that!  It&apos;s the most celebrated holiday in Versal!  Well... it&apos;s actually the only holiday celebrated in Versal.  But it&apos;s still wonderful, nonetheless!\r\n\r\n#b#L0#Um, so why are you here?  Shouldn&apos;t you be in Versal for that?#l#k"/>
			<string name="3" value="As for why I&apos;m here, it&apos;s a strange story.  As the Versalmas Mouse, I&apos;m bound by Versalmas law to deliver a present to every Versalian, no matter how far and wide they are located in Versal.  Whew, it&apos;s no easy task I tell you!  I had crossed off everyone on my list except for one last name -- Elpam Gorlab!\r\nI had Elpam&apos;s gift all ready to go, but I couldn&apos;t find him anywhere!  So, I asked my trusty steed, Pwnzer, to &quot;sniff&quot; out where he was, and take me to him, crackity-splat!\r\n\r\n#b#L0#Er, I&apos;m guessing Pwnzer is a reindeer?#l#k"/>

Hoy, that would have been a first -- an undelivered gift!  Elpam was just as surprised to see me here -- why, he almost fell down from his perch on that metal tower!  &lt;chuckles&gt; It was a pleasant surprise though, I assume!\r\n\r\n#b#L0#I&apos;m sure...#l#k"/>
			<string name="5" value="After giving Elpam his gift, which he was happy to receive, I asked him for more information about where &quot;here&quot; was. He told me that this place is called the &quot;Maple World,&quot; a place I had only heard about in Versalian legend!  In these tales, it&apos;s said that the sun shines in this world everyday!  When Elpam told me that this was actually true, I almost fell over!  And you can imagine how hard that would be to do given my size! &lt;chuckles&gt; I never thought the legends to be true!\r\nEven now, I can hardly believe it!  The welcome sight of an eternal sun swells my chest with happiness! At first, I was at a lost to be in a different world, but I&apos;ve realized that this also makes the Maple World a perfect place for Versalmas!\r\n\r\n#b#L0#A perfect place for Versalmas?  Um... why is that?#l#k"/>
			<string name="6" value="Because Versalmas is a celebration of the Sun!  You see, in Versal, it is perpetually dark... I believe that you have &quot;night&quot; here as well.  Well, it is night all the time in Versal.  But once a year, our sun comes back... for 30 glorious days straight, which we call the &quot;30 Days of Delight&quot;!  Versalmas Day is the first of these days, and each day after, while the sun shines, we celebrate Versalmas.  Each day of Versalmas, everyone, not just the young, receive gifts from their loved ones. So you see, because the sun shines here in the Maple World every day, why then... it&apos;s Versalmas here every day!  Hooray!\r\n\r\n#b#L0#Well the gift-giving part sounds a bit like our Maplemas.  Er, have you heard about Maplemas?#l#k"/>
			<string name="7" value="That is what everyone I&apos;ve met has been telling me!  It does seem that your Maplemas is very similar to our Versalmas.  This is quite exciting to me!  Perhaps we can exchange customs and gifts!\r\n\r\n#b#L0#What are the differences?  Do you have different foods and traditions for Versalmas?#l#k\r\n#b#L1#That seems to be the problem.  Do you remember a girl named Suzy?  She asked me to speak with you.#l#k"/>
			<string name="8" value="Ah, I remember speaking with that lovely little child earlier in my walk through this wonderful city--just after I delivered Elpam&apos;s gift. She told me about how she loved candy canes, and I told her in turn about our #bSugar-coated Olives#k, which are simply delicious! She seemed very excited about new types of presents and told me all about her #bWishlist#k. My, my, that girl certainly wants quite a few specific things!\r\nSo you say that she needs help to determine whether she should celebrate Versalmas this year?  Hoy, then... would you be kind enough to convey a message to her from me?"/>

				<string name="0" value="Thank you.  I understand that she - and you, for that matter - may be used to your own traditions for the holidays.

Food is one of the hallmarks of Versalmas tradition, and personally my favorite part!\r\n Whereas you people here enjoy what you call your &quot;#bMaplemas Ham#k,&quot; we have #bSmoked Salmon#k for our traditional dinner, which sounds much more delicious to me!  I hope you get the chance to try some!  And perhaps I will try your ham as well!  There are also a host of other traditional holiday dishes, such as those tasty #bCaramel Onions#k and my favorite, #bSugar-coated Olives#k!  I am happy to say that I have a bag full of these with me which I would be happy to share! The most popular Versalmas gifts are gifts of food!\r\nI have also heard that you decorate a tree with lights and ornamentation.  We do the same!  Only we decorate a #bCactus#k instead.  We Versalians sing many of our songs of praise to the sun as we dance around our #bVersalmas Cactus#k!  And... er, you may have noticed that Versalians are somewhat pale.
